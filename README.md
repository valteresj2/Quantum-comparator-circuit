# Quantum-comparator-circuit
This project is a quantum comparator circuit using the SDK of IBM what is qiskit in the version 0.6.1, the version of python is the 3.6.5.

# Limitation

If we greatly increase the size of qubits the process slowed down due to the high memory consumption, in this circuit was not applied the superposition process that are the doors of hadarmad, that is, the quantum parallelism and with that we would bring a gigantic gain, that will stay for future work, if anyone has interest I'm open for this extension.
